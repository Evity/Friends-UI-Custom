# Custom-Metro-UI-For-Steam
# Custom Metro UI for new Steam chat and friends UI  * I wanted to style the new Steam UI and Friends UI to look like Metro For Steam.   ## How to install: * [Download](https://github.com/PhantomGamers/EnableNewSteamFriendsSkin/releases) the latest patcher to enable customization. * Download the css and put in your Steam/clientui/ folder. * Launch the patcher and follow its instructions. * Reopen the friends list to apply the new changes.  ## Uninstallation * Just remove friends.custom.css from Steam/clientui/  ## Special thanks to:  * [RedSigma](https://github.com/redsigma) * [PhantomGamers](https://github.com/PhantomGamers) * [Shiina](https://github.com/AikoMidori) * [Rose](https://github.com/RoseTheFlower)
